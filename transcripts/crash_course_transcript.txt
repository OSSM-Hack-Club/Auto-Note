0.0:  Hello learned and astonishingly attractive pupils.

2.3:  My name is John Green and I want to welcome you to Crash Course World History.

6.18:  Over the next 40 weeks, together we will learn how in a mere 15,000 years, humans went from hunting and gathering...

12.18:  Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Is this going to be on the test?

15.0:  Yeah, about the test. The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world.

20.52:  And it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship.

0.0:  You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football, and while scrolling through your Twitter feed.

5.3:  The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages,

8.8:  whether you'll be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric,

11.96:  and whether you'll be able to place your life and your community in a broader context.

16.12:  The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that, when taken together, make your life yours.

24.32:  And everything, everything, will be on it.

27.62:  I know, right? So pay attention.

0.0:  In a mere 15,000 years, humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities

12.5:  as the airplane, the internet, and the 99-cent double cheeseburger.

16.48:  It's an extraordinary journey, one that I will now symbolize by embarking upon a journey

20.26:  of my own.

21.38:  Over to camera two.

22.38:  Hi there, camera two.

23.38:  It's me, John Green.

24.38:  Let's start with that double cheeseburger.

25.38:  Oh, food photography.

0.0:  So this hot hunk of meat contains 490 calories. To get this cheeseburger, you have to feed,

4.2:  raise, and slaughter cows, then grind their meat, then freeze it and ship it to its destination.

8.5:  You also gotta grow some wheat and then process the living crap out of it until it's whiter

12.14:  than Queen Elizabeth I. Then you gotta milk some cows and turn their milk into cheese,

15.88:  and that's not even to mention the growing and pickling of cucumbers, or the sweetening

19.46:  of tomatoes, or the grinding of mustard seeds, etc.

22.82:  How in the sweet name of everything holy did we ever come to live in a world in which such

0.0:  a thing can even be created, and how is it possible that those 490 calories can be served

5.76:  to me for an amount of money that if I make the minimum wage here in the US, I can earn

10.32:  in 11 minutes?

12.14:  And most importantly, should I be delighted or alarmed to live in this strange world of

16.64:  relative abundance?

17.64:  Well, to answer that question, we're not going to be able to look strictly at history,

21.58:  because there isn't a written record about a lot of these things, but thanks to archaeology

25.16:  and paleobiology, we can look deep into the past.

28.8:  Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

0.0:  15,000 years ago, humans were foragers and hunters.

3.54:  Foraging meant gathering fruits, nuts, also wild grains and grasses.

7.48:  Hunting allowed for a more protein-rich diet, so long as you could find something with meat

10.78:  to kill.

11.78:  By far the best hunting gig in the prehistoric world, incidentally, was fishing.

14.58:  Which is one of the reasons that if you look at the history of people populating the planet,

17.48:  we tended to run for the shore and then stay there.

20.24:  Marine life was A, abundant, and B, relatively unlikely to eat you.

24.24:  While we tend to think that the lives of foragers were nasty, brutish, and short, fossil evidence

27.84:  suggests that they actually had it pretty good.

0.0:  Their bones and teeth are healthier than those of agriculturalists, and anthropologists who've

4.34:  studied the remaining forager peoples have noted that they actually spend a lot fewer

8.28:  hours working than the rest of us, and they spend more time on art, music, and storytelling.

13.6:  Also, if you believe the classic of anthropology Nisa, they also have a lot more time for scoodily-poopin'.

18.12:  What? I call it scoodily-poopin'. I'm not going to apologize.

20.66:  It's worth noting that cultivation of crops seems to have arisen independently over the

24.26:  course of millennia in a number of places, from Africa to China to the Americas.

0.0:  crops that naturally grew nearby, rice in Southeast Asia, maize in Mexico, potatoes

4.9:  in the Andes, wheat in the Fertile Crescent, yams in West Africa, people around the world

8.92:  began to abandon their foraging for agriculture. And since so many communities made this choice

14.26:  independently, it must have been a good choice, right? Even though it meant less music and

19.36:  scoodily-pooping. Thanks, Thought Bubble. Alright, to answer that question, let's

22.3:  take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture.

25.7:  Controllable food supply. You might have droughts or floods, but if you're growing

0.0:  the crops and breeding them to be hardier, you have a better chance of not starving.

4.24:  in order to keep feeding people as the population grows, you have to radically

8.28:  change the environment of the planet.

10.34:  especially if you grow grain, you can create a food surplus, which makes cities

14.56:  possible and also the specialization of labor. Like, in the days before agriculture, everybody's

19.76:  job was foraging, and it took about a thousand calories of work to create a thousand calories

25.28:  of food. And it was impossible to create large population centers. But if you have a surplus,

0.0:  can support people not directly involved in the production of food.

3.58:  Like for instance, tradespeople who can devote their lives to better farming equipment, which

7.76:  in turn makes it easier to produce more food more efficiently, which in time makes it possible

13.6:  for a corporation to turn a profit on this 99 cent double cheeseburger.

18.0:  This is delicious by the way.

21.96:  It's actually terrible.

22.96:  And it's very cold.

24.94:  And I wish that I had not eaten it.

26.12:  I mean, can we just compare what I was promised to what I was delivered?

0.0:  Yep, thank you. Yep, this is not that.

2.7:  Some would say that large and complex agricultural communities that can support cities and eventually inexpensive meat sandwiches

9.16:  are not necessarily beneficial to the planet or even to its human inhabitants.

14.04:  Although that's a bit of a tough argument to make coming to you as I am in a series of ones and zeros.

18.76:  Agriculture can be practiced all over the world, although in some cases it takes extensive manipulation of the environment,

24.7:  like, you know, irrigation, controlled flooding, terracing, that kind of thing.

0.0:  Farming is hard. So hard, in fact, that one is tempted to claim ownership over other humans

6.46:  and then have them till the land on your behalf, which is the kind of non-ideal social order

11.24:  that tends to be associated with agricultural communities.

14.2:  So why did agriculture happen? Wait, I haven't talked about herders. Herders, man! Always

18.38:  getting the short end of the stick.

20.2:  Herding is a really good and interesting alternative to foraging and agriculture. You domesticate

24.4:  some animals and then you take them on the road with you. The advantages of herding are

0.0:  First, you get to be a cowboy.

2.0:  Also, animals provide meat and milk, but they also help out with shelter because they can provide wool and leather.

8.3:  The downside is that you have to move around a lot because your herd always needs new grass,

11.8:  which makes it hard to build cities unless you are the Mongols.

17.2:  By the way, over the next 40 weeks you will frequently hear generalizations followed by,

21.0:  unless you are the Mongols.

24.9:  But anyway, one of the main reasons herding only caught on in certain parts of the world

0.0:  is that there aren't that many animals that lend themselves to domestication.

3.94:  Like you have sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, horses, camels, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks,

9.56:  all of which have something in common, they aren't native to the Americas.

13.2:  The only halfway useful herding animal native to the Americas is the llama.

17.48:  No, not that llama.

18.58:  Two L's. Yes, that llama.

21.22:  Most animals just don't work for domestication, like hippos are large, which means they provide lots of meat,

26.2:  but unfortunately they like to eat people.

0.0:  Zebras are too ornery, grizzlies have wild hearts that can't be broken, elephants are awesome

5.38:  But they take way too long to breed. Which reminds me it's time for the open letter

14.16:  Elegant. But first let's see what the secret compartment has for me today. Oh, it's another double cheeseburger. Thanks secret compartment

22.08:  Just kidding. I don't thank you for this. An open letter to elephants. Hey elephants

0.0:  You're so cute and smart and awesome. Why you got to be pregnant for 22 months?

4.08:  That's crazy!

4.88:  And then you only have one kid!

6.88:  If you were more like cows, you might have taken us over by now.

10.16:  Little did you know, but the greatest evolutionary advantage?

14.08:  Being useful to humans.

16.0:  Like here is a graph of cow population, and here is a graph of elephant population.

21.68:  Elephants, if you just inserted yourself into human life the way cows did,

24.96:  you could have used your power and intelligence to form secret elephant societies,

0.0:  conspiring against the humans. And then you could have risen up and destroyed us and made

4.68:  an awesome elephant world with elephant cars and elephant planes. It would have been so

9.24:  great, but nooo, you gotta be pregnant for 22 months and then have just one kid. It's

14.68:  so annoying. Best wishes, John Green.

17.88:  Right, but back to the agricultural revolution and why it occurred. Historians don't know

21.56:  for sure, of course, because there are no written records, but they love to make guesses.

25.48:  Maybe population pressure necessitated agriculture even though it was more work, or abundance

0.0:  gave people leisure to experiment with domestication, or planting originated as a fertility rite,

5.78:  or as some historians have argued, people needed to domesticate grains in order to produce

10.26:  more alcohol.

11.26:  Charles Darwin, like most 19th century scientists, believed agriculture was an accident, saying,

15.82:  "...a wild and unusually good variety of native plant might attract the attention of

20.16:  some wise old savage."

22.1:  Off topic, but you will note in the coming weeks that the definition of savage tends

25.36:  to be, not me.

0.0:  Maybe the best theory is that there wasn't really an agricultural revolution at all,

3.3:  but that agriculture came out of an evolutionary desire to eat more.

7.54:  Like early hunter-gatherers knew that seeds germinate when planted, and when you find

12.38:  something that makes food, you want to do more of it.

15.12:  Unless it's this food.

16.82:  Then you want to do less of it.

18.12:  I kind of want to spit it out.

19.68:  Oh, that's much better.

23.92:  So early farmers would find the most accessible forms of wheat and plant them and experiment

0.0:  with them, not because they were trying to start an agricultural revolution, because

3.38:  they were like, you know what would be awesome? More food.

6.0:  Like on this topic, we have evidence that more than 13,000 years ago, humans in southern

9.98:  Greece were domesticating snails. In the Fronkvi cave, there's a huge pile of snail shells.

14.96:  Most of them are larger than current snails, suggesting that the people who ate them were

17.92:  selectively breeding them to be bigger and more nutritious. Snails make excellent domesticated

22.56:  food sources, by the way, because A surprisingly caloric, B they're easy to carry since they

0.0:  they come with their own suitcases, and C to imprison them you just have to scratch

3.84:  a ditch around their living quarters. That's not really a revolution, that's just people

7.58:  trying to increase available calories. But one non-revolution leads to another, and pretty

11.6:  soon you have this as far as the eye can see.

14.36:  Many historians also argue that without agriculture we wouldn't have all the bad things that

17.72:  come with complex civilizations like patriarchy, inequality, war, and unfortunately famine.

23.7:  And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser. Without it, humans never

0.0:  would have changed the environment so much, building dams and clearing forests and more

4.76:  recently drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer.

7.76:  Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean it was the

10.7:  right choice? Maybe so and maybe not, but regardless, we can't unmake that choice.

16.24:  And that's one of the reasons I think it's so important to study history. History reminds

19.66:  us that revolutions are not events so much as they're processes. That for tens of thousands

24.32:  of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we

0.0:  we live in today. Just as today we're making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people

4.6:  of the future will remember as revolutions.

7.22:  Next week we're going to journey to the Indus River Valley. Whoa. It's very fragile,

11.36:  our globe. Like the real globe. We're going to travel to the Indus River Valley. I'll

15.72:  see you then.

17.22:  Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

21.8:  The show is written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and myself. And our graphics

26.26:  team is Thought Bubble. If you want to guess at the phrase of the week, you can do so in

0.0:  comments. You can also suggest future phrases of the week. And if you have a question about

3.52:  today's video, please leave it in comments where our team of semi-professional quasi-historians

7.76:  will aim to answer it. Thanks for watching, and as we say in my hometown, don't forget

11.42:  to be awesome.
