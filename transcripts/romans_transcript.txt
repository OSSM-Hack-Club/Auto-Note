0.0:  Romans, they existed. Then some stuff happened, and now they don't. And the people who live in

5.34:  Rome's former heartlands are now called Italians. But when did this change occur?

9.96:  When did the Romans become Italians? Now, the answer to this question is

13.8:  dependent on what your definition of Roman is. Is it a person living in the Roman Empire,

18.38:  people identifying themselves as Roman, speaking Latin, or upholding the ideals of the Roman

22.8:  Empire? If it's living in the Roman Empire, then for the people in what's now Italy,

0.0:  it was roughly 476 that it all came to an end. Sort of. You see, despite them being a part of

5.28:  the brand new Kingdom of Italy, the first one that is, they still had a Roman Senate, in fact they

9.52:  still had the Roman Senate, would have spoken Latin, and were officially a client state of

13.28:  what was left of the Roman Empire in the East. Many who lived there still considered themselves

17.22:  to be Romans, and Odoacer, Italy's new ruler, referred to himself as being king of both Romans

21.46:  and Goths. Odoacer's successors mostly used the same terminology, but it wasn't long until Emperor

0.0:  Justinian and his trusty general Belisarius came knocking and reconquered Italy on behalf

4.0:  of Constantinople. They held onto it all for about seven minutes before the Lombards turned

8.52:  up and conquered some, and then a lot of, the territory of Italy. Importantly, the Eastern

12.72:  Roman Empire still held onto some lands there which started the long-running political divisions

16.92:  of the Italian peninsula. However, in the territories ruled by the Lombards the institutions

21.3:  of the Roman Empire, notably the Senate, were abolished and so began some good old fashioned

25.28:  absolute feudal monarchy. That said, the idolisation of Rome persisted and Roman law remained

0.0:  dominant. After this, the process of change was a slow one. The Lombards maintained control over

4.76:  much of Italy despite making up about 5% of its population for over two centuries,

9.1:  and the kings there soon stopped referring to their subjects as Romans but as Lombards.

13.2:  Whilst at first both Roman and Germanic law was used, over time Germanic law became the dominant

17.38:  one. Whereas in the parts ruled by Byzantium, Greek became the language of government,

21.36:  but the people there were still considered to be Romans. That said, there were cultural

24.76:  differences now between the Byzantine Romans and their subjects living in Italy. When religious

0.0:  This further led to the empire-wide iconoclasm, the destruction of images on religious grounds

4.14:  the Romans living in Italy didn't bother.

6.28:  When the Franks turned up in the 8th century and conquered most of the peninsula, the people

9.76:  living there were not considered to be Romans by most outsiders.

13.06:  Latin was still the primary language of the region and over the next four centuries it

16.36:  slowly morphed into medieval Italian.

18.54:  So with Rome done and its identity a thing of the past, when did the people in Italy

22.02:  become Italians?

23.24:  Well, regional identities separated along political lines.

0.0:  Phoenicians, Florentines, Neapolitans and of course, Romans, but in the sense of living

4.2:  in and around the city of Rome, not being literal citizens of the Roman Empire.

7.96:  It wasn't until the Renaissance that the idea of the people who lived in Italy all

11.08:  being Italians in a much deeper sense started to pop up. This process was a very slow one,

15.62:  but it took off after the Napoleonic Wars. This was when the people living in the Italian

19.5:  peninsula got fed up of all these foreign powers ruling over them and fighting their

22.74:  wars there, and as such writers and activists started to define what an Italian was and

0.0:  how to build them a nation. Yet, even after Italy was born, many of the people who lived

4.06:  there still saw themselves identified first and foremost by the region of their birth.

7.76:  But, for most of the people living in the Italian peninsula, they were Italians,

11.4:  no longer Romans proper, but the successors and bearers of their legacy.
